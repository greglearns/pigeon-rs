  Curious to see if we can help you now, given that you signed up early before we made major changes based upon user feedback.

  The website version is fully functional at www.FindYourDime.com — people are matching and chatting, and saying they like it. The app store version is probably 4+ weeks away.

  There are some great people on the site, and they're wanting more matches, and so reaching out to you before we start reaching out to new people.

  Now’s a great time to finish your profile and give it another shot, if you're up for it. If there is something more that you wish for, we really do listen.

  Why FindYourDime?
  * Everyone takes Positive Consent training before matching.
  * Unlimited free matches and you can see who likes you.
  * The site helps you move beyond swipe/chat to actually meet, and is less shallow.
  * We actually want to help you get into a better relationship.
