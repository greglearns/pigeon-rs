  Have you seen the "1st meeting checklist" button on the chat screen?

  It's designed to reduce ghosting and make it easier (and more successful) to meet in person.

  Did you know that 60-90% of chats on dating apps don't go anywhere and just ... fizzle out, with no one feeling happy or meeting.

  Here's what we recommend:
  1. Check out what we put together for the "1st meeting checklist" on the chat page.
  2. Let us know what you think, and if there is anything you wish that was better.
  3. Message the person you're chatting with that you've read it and agree to it (so that they can feel more comfortable, which can increase the chance of meeting), and/or discuss it with them.
  4. Lots of people like to discuss some plans for what you will talk about and do when you meet. This is an actual good use of chatting before meeting.
  5. Practice Positive Consent -- Recommend a day, time, and a (safe, public) location where you two can meet. Some people like last minute plans (want to get together tomorrow?) but lots of people prefer planning days or a week in advance, so you likely want to suggest multiple days and times and not wait until the last minute.
  6. Remember Positive Consent and Anger Reduction: if it doesn't work out, be okay with that. There will be other opportunities with other people.
  7. Let us know how it goes (good or bad).

  No other dating site provides this (that we're aware of), so would love love love to get your feedback on it so that we can fix it and/or make it better.

  Best wishes!
